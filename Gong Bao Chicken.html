         <h2>Recipe ofGong Boa Chicken</h2>
           </center></div>
           <p>
   Ingredients:
<br/>1/3 cup unsalted peanuts
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1 tablespoon cornstarch
4 tablespoons light soy sauce
2 tablespoons unroasted peanut oil or other neutral oil
1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns
2 dried red chiles, roughly chopped or crushed
2 garlic cloves, peeled and very thinly sliced
1-inch knob ginger root, peeled and very thinly sliced
4 scallions, trimmed and roughly chopped
Cooked white rice, for serving
               <br/>
Directions:
            <br/>   
Combine the chicken, corn starch, and half the soy sauce in a small bowl. Toss the chicken until it's well-coated in the mixture, and set aside.
Meanwhile, heat a large, dry skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the peanuts and cook, gently tossing occasionally, until they're golden brown and fragrant, 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.
Heat the oil in the skillet or wok over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the Sichuan peppercorns and dried chiles and cook, stirring continuously, until the chiles turn a light brown in color.
Turn the heat to high and add the marinated chicken. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until starting to turn golden, then add the garlic, ginger, scallions, and peanuts. Continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, 1-2 minutes more.
Remove from the heat, pour the remaining soy sauce over the chicken, and serve immediately with rice.
