         <h2>Recipe of Butter Tarts</h2>
           </center></div>
           <p>
<br/>
INGREDIENTS Nutrition:
<br/>1 cup butter, melted
3 tablespoons vinegar
4 eggs, lightly beaten
4 cups brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla
1⁄4 cup currants
<br/><br/>DIRECTIONS:
Line tart tins with pastry. Sprinkle 6-8 currants into each tart shell.
Let butter cool to room temp, then add the remaining ingredients. Stir until smooth.
Spoon into unbaked tart shells, filling about 2/3 full.
Bake at 200F for 15 min, then without taking the tarts out, turn the oven to 350°F Bake another 10-15 min, until they start to brown. This method will prevent them from boiling over.
Note: I use Tenderflake lard and make the pastry using the instructions on the box, chilling the dough before rolling. Roll it a little thicker than for pie pastry, and use a little extra flour.
