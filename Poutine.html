           </center></div>
           <p>
   Ingredients:
25 m 4 servings 708 cals 1 quart vegetable oil for frying 1 (10.25 ounce) can beef gravy 5 medium potatoes, cut into fries 2 cups cheese curds
<br/>
               Directions:
Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). While the oil is heating, you can begin to warm your gravy.
Place the fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, about 5 minutes. Make the fries in batches if necessary to allow them room to move a little in the oil. Remove to a paper towel lined plate to drain.
Place the fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle the cheese over them. Ladle gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately.
