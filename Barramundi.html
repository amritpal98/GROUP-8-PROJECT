         <h2>Recipe of Barramundi</h2>
           </center></div>
           <p>
   Ingredients:
<br/>4	(6 oz. ) Barramundi fillets,
1/2	tsp salt, divided,
1/2	tsp ground pepper, divided,
4	tsp olive oil, divided,
12	oz. crimini mushrooms, thinly sliced,
3	tbsp minced shallots,
1	garlic clove, minced,
1	tbsp all-purpose flour,
3/4	cup chicken broth,
3/4	cup Marsala wine,
3	tbsp minced flat-leaf parsley.
<br/><br/>Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and coat with cooking spray.
Place the barramundi fillets on the prepared baking sheet, rub with 1 teaspoon olive oil and season with ¼ teaspoon and ¼ teaspoon pepper.
Bake until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat. Cook the mushrooms until they release and then reabsorb their juices, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl.
Heat 1 teaspoons olive oil in the skillet. Add the shallots and garlic, and cook until the shallots are starting to soften, about 2 minutes.
Add the remaining teaspoon of olive oil, then stir in the flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Pour in the chicken broth and Marsala wine and simmer, stirring frequently, until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Season with the remaining ¼ teaspoon of salt and pepper.
Add the cooked fish and mushrooms to the skillet and cook until the fish is heated, about 2 minutes.
Garnish with parsley and serve.
