           </center></div>
           <p>
   Ingredients:
<br/>
Italian Chicken Parmesan is prepared with chicken breasts, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, eggs, bread crumbs, olive oil, tomato sauce and seasonings. It is often served with spaghetti.
               <br/>
Directins:
           <br/>
Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a saucepan on medium-high heat. Add half a large yellow onion, grate it, and sauté for two or three minutes. Add two cloves of minced garlic. Cook about a minute more, then add one 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of oregano, a pinch of red pepper flakes and a pinch of sugar. Let the mixture simmer in the pan.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Thin four chicken breast cutlets with a meat hammer, mallet or rolling pin to 1/4 to 1/2 inch in thickness. Sprinkle both sides with salt.

Mix 1 cup breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and a pinch of salt in a shallow bowl. In another shallow bowl, whisk together two eggs.

In a large sauté pan heat 1/4 cup of olive oil on medium-high heat until a piece of breading dropped into it sizzles. Dip the chicken cutlets into the egg mixture, then into the breadcrumbs, and fry the chicken on medium until they are golden brown.

Pour 14 ounces tomato sauce into a 9x13 baking dish. Arrange the cutlets on top of the tomato sauce in the baking dish. Spoon the remaining tomato sauce over the cutlets. Sprinkle it with sliced basil, lay sliced mozzarella cheese over each cutlet, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Bake in the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit until the mozzarella begins to brown.
