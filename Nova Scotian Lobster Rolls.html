               DIRECTIONS:
<br/><br/>1. Heat the oil and butter in a large soup/stock pot over medium high heat. Add the vegetables, cooking until caramelized, about 8-10 minutes.

<br/><br/>2. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute more before adding the lobster shells and brandy. Carefully flambé the brandy.

<br/><br/>3. Add the white wine, scraping the brown bits of fond from the bottom of the pot, stirring until almost completely reduced.

<br/><br/>4. Sprinkle the flour into the pot, and stir well, cooking for 2-3 minutes. Slowly add the stock, mixing so it is smooth and free of lumps, then drop in the garlic, bay leaves, thyme, parsley and peppercorns.

<br/><br/>5. Bring to a simmer and gently cook for 30-40 minutes, skimming away the foamy impurities that rise to the surface during cooking with a ladle as it simmers.

<br/><br/>6. Strain the bisque, reserving only the liquid, return to a simmer, add the cream and season with sea salt and white pepper to taste.

<br/><br/>7. Serve in a warm soup bowl garnished with some of the lobster meat, fresh chives and sour cream. Enjoy!
